# @labs/ui Component Library

Welcome to the **@labs/ui** component library. This library is built following **Atomic Design principles** and is powered by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Organization

Components are organized into the following categories:

- **Atoms**: The smallest, indivisible building blocks (e.g., Button, Badge, Avatar, Spinner).
- **Molecules**: Simple combinations of atoms (e.g., Card, Alert, Accordion, Tooltip).
- **Forms**: Components for user data entry (e.g., Input, Checkbox).
- **Navigation**: Components to help users move through the app (e.g., Breadcrumb, Command).
- **Feedback**: Components for user interaction feedback (e.g., Dialog, Alert Dialog).
- **Data Display**: Components for presenting data (e.g., AspectRatio, Calendar, Carousel).

## Features

- **Accessible**: Built on top of Radix UI primitives for maximum accessibility.
- **Customizable**: Styled with Tailwind CSS and fully themable via CSS variables.
- **Composable**: Designed to be used together to build complex interfaces.
- **Dark Mode**: First-class support for dark mode.
